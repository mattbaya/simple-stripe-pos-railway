# Raffle Fee Calculation Mathematical Error Fix

## Problem Description

A critical mathematical error was discovered in the raffle ticket fee calculation system. The system was incorrectly calculating processing fees based on a computed amount (quantity × $0.80) rather than the actual package prices, resulting in incorrect fee calculations and total amounts.

## Specific Issue Example

### User Experience Problem:
When a user selected "12 tickets for $10.00" package and opted to cover processing fees:

**❌ Incorrect Calculation (Before Fix):**
```
User Selection: 12 tickets for $10.00
System Display: "Selected: 12 tickets for $10.00"
Fee Calculation Base: 12 × $0.80 = $9.60 (WRONG)
Processing Fee: $9.60 × 0.029 + $0.30 = $0.58
Total with Fees: $9.60 + $0.58 = $10.18
```

**UI Display Error:**
```
Base amount: $9.60
Processing fee: $0.58
Total: $10.18
```

This created confusion because:
1. User selected a $10.00 package
2. System showed "Selected: 12 tickets for $10.00"
3. But fee breakdown showed base amount as $9.60
4. Mathematical inconsistency was obvious to users

## Root Cause Analysis

### Frontend-Backend Data Flow Issue:
1. **Frontend State Management**: Correctly tracked `selectedRafflePrice = 10.00` for package selection
2. **Fee Calculation Request**: Only sent `raffle_quantity` to backend, not the actual package price
3. **Backend Calculation**: Recalculated amount using `quantity × RAFFLE_PRICE_PER_TICKET` formula
4. **Mathematical Error**: Backend ignored package discounts and used per-ticket pricing

### Code Analysis:

#### Frontend State (Correct):
```javascript
// User selects $10 package
selectedRaffleQuantity = 12;
selectedRafflePrice = 10.00; // ✅ Correct package price
```

#### Backend Calculation (Incorrect):
```python
# In both calculate-fees and create-payment-intent routes
elif payment_type == 'raffle':
    base_amount = int(raffle_quantity * RAFFLE_PRICE_PER_TICKET)  # ❌ Wrong formula
    # This calculated: 12 × 80 = 960 cents = $9.60
```

## Solution Implementation

### Strategy:
Instead of recalculating amounts on the backend, use the actual package prices from the frontend where the business logic for package pricing already exists.

### Frontend Changes (templates/index.html):

#### 1. Fee Calculation Update:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Line ~634)
} else if (selectedPaymentType === 'raffle') {
    raffleQuantity = selectedRaffleQuantity;
    if (raffleQuantity <= 0) {
        feeBreakdown.style.display = 'none';
        document.getElementById('fee-description').textContent = 'Cover the processing fee';
        return;
    }
}

// AFTER
} else if (selectedPaymentType === 'raffle') {
    raffleQuantity = selectedRaffleQuantity;
    amount = selectedRafflePrice; // ✅ Use actual package price, not quantity × $0.80
    if (raffleQuantity <= 0) {
        feeBreakdown.style.display = 'none';
        document.getElementById('fee-description').textContent = 'Cover the processing fee';
        return;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Payment Processing Update:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Line ~737)
} else if (selectedPaymentType === 'raffle') {
    raffleQuantity = selectedRaffleQuantity;
    if (raffleQuantity <= 0) {
        showStatus('Please select a raffle package', 'error');
        return;
    }
}

// AFTER
} else if (selectedPaymentType === 'raffle') {
    raffleQuantity = selectedRaffleQuantity;
    amount = Math.round(selectedRafflePrice * 100); // ✅ Convert package price to cents
    if (raffleQuantity <= 0) {
        showStatus('Please select a raffle package', 'error');
        return;
    }
}
```

### Backend Changes (app/main.py):

#### 1. Calculate Fees Route Update:
```python
# BEFORE (Line ~575-578)
elif payment_type == 'raffle':
    if not raffle_quantity or raffle_quantity <= 0:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid raffle ticket quantity'}), 400
    base_amount = int(raffle_quantity * RAFFLE_PRICE_PER_TICKET)  # ❌ 80 cents per ticket

# AFTER
elif payment_type == 'raffle':
    if not raffle_quantity or raffle_quantity <= 0:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid raffle ticket quantity'}), 400
    if not amount or amount <= 0:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid raffle package amount'}), 400
    base_amount = int(amount * 100)  # ✅ Convert package price to cents
```

#### 2. Create Payment Intent Route Update:
```python
# BEFORE (Line ~629-631)
elif payment_type == 'raffle':
    base_amount = int(raffle_quantity * RAFFLE_PRICE_PER_TICKET)  # ❌ 80 cents per ticket
    description = f"Raffle tickets purchase from {payer_name} - {raffle_quantity} tickets"

# AFTER
elif payment_type == 'raffle':
    base_amount = int(amount)  # ✅ Amount is already in cents from frontend
    description = f"Raffle tickets purchase from {payer_name} - {raffle_quantity} tickets"
```

## Verification of Fix

### Correct Calculations After Fix:

#### Package 1: 5 tickets for $5.00
```
Base Amount: $5.00
Processing Fee: $5.00 × 0.029 + $0.30 = $0.145 + $0.30 = $0.445 ≈ $0.45
Total with Fees: $5.00 + $0.45 = $5.45
```

#### Package 2: 12 tickets for $10.00
```
Base Amount: $10.00
Processing Fee: $10.00 × 0.029 + $0.30 = $0.29 + $0.30 = $0.59
Total with Fees: $10.00 + $0.59 = $10.59
```

#### Package 3: 25 tickets for $20.00
```
Base Amount: $20.00
Processing Fee: $20.00 × 0.029 + $0.30 = $0.58 + $0.30 = $0.88
Total with Fees: $20.00 + $0.88 = $20.88
```

#### Custom Quantities (26+ tickets)
```
Base Amount: Quantity × $0.80 (per-ticket pricing)
Processing Fee: Base Amount × 0.029 + $0.30
Total with Fees: Base Amount + Processing Fee
```

## Business Logic Preservation

### Package Discounts Maintained:
- **5 tickets for $5.00**: $1.00 per ticket (best discount)
- **12 tickets for $10.00**: $0.83 per ticket (good discount)  
- **25 tickets for $20.00**: $0.80 per ticket (standard rate)
- **26+ tickets**: $0.80 per ticket (standard rate)

### Fee Calculation Logic:
- **Preset Packages**: Fees calculated on discounted package prices
- **Custom Quantities**: Fees calculated on quantity × $0.80
- **All Cases**: Stripe's standard 2.9% + $0.30 fee structure applied correctly

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience:
- **✅ Eliminated Confusion**: Fee breakdown now matches displayed selection
- **✅ Mathematical Consistency**: Base amount in fee breakdown matches package price
- **✅ Transparent Pricing**: Users see exactly what they're paying for

### Financial Accuracy:

- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to work if validation fails

## Testing Verification

### Test Cases Verified:
1. **Package Selection**: All three preset packages calculate fees correctly
2. **Custom Quantities**: 26+ ticket purchases use per-ticket pricing
3. **Fee Coverage Option**: Optional fee coverage works for all raffle types
4. **Form State Management**: Selection state preserved during fee calculations
5. **Payment Processing**: Stripe receives correct amounts for all scenarios

### Edge Cases Handled:
- **Zero Quantity**: Proper validation prevents invalid selections
- **Invalid Amounts**: Backend validates both quantity and amount parameters
- **State Transitions**: Switching between packages maintains calculation accuracy

## Files Modified

### 1. templates/index.html
- **Lines Modified**: ~634, ~737
