## Cost Management

### Usage Monitoring
- **Railway Dashboard**: Shows exact usage hours and costs
- **Billing**: Monthly billing with per-minute precision
- **Estimates**: ~$0.10-0.20/hour depending on usage

### Cost Examples

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Issues
1. Check Stripe dashboard for detailed error messages
2. Verify terminal is online and connected to WiFi  
3. Ensure you're using live (not test) API keys for real payments
4. Check Railway logs in dashboard

### Email Issues
1. Verify Gmail API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
2. Check OAuth2 credentials and refresh token
3. Test email sending with a small transaction first
4. Review Railway application logs

### Railway-Specific Issues
1. **App won't start**: Check environment variables are set correctly
2. **Timeouts**: Railway has request timeout limits for idle connections
3. **Domain issues**: DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours
4. **Costs higher than expected**: Check if app is sleeping properly

## Security Notes

- Railway provides HTTPS automatically
