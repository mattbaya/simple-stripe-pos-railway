## 💳 Payment Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User visits web interface] --> B[Select donation or membership type]
    B --> C[Enter amount, name, and email]
    C --> D[Optional: Select fee coverage]
    D --> E[System creates Stripe PaymentIntent]
    E --> F[Payment processed on S700 terminal]
    F --> G[Success modal with organization branding]
    G --> H[Email receipt sent to user]
    H --> I[Notification email sent to organization]
    I --> J[Transaction stored in Stripe]
```

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. 🖥️ User selects donation or membership (individual/household) on web interface
2. ✍️ User enters amount (for donations), name, and **required** email address
3. 💰 User optionally selects fee coverage (shows transparent breakdown)
4. 🔄 System creates Stripe PaymentIntent with calculated amount
5. 💳 Payment processed on S700 terminal hardware
6. ✅ Success shows professional modal with organization logo and payment details
7. 📧 Automatic HTML email receipt sent to user with embedded letterhead
8. 📬 Organization notification email sent for tracking purposes
9. 💾 All transaction data stored in Stripe, no local database
