# 🚂 Railway POS System - Deployment Status & Configuration

## 📋 Current Status

**Railway Project Created:** ✅  
**Project Name:** simple-stripe-pos-railway  
**Service Name:** jubilant-healing  
**Live URL:** https://jubilant-healing-production.up.railway.app  
**GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/mattbaya/simple-stripe-pos-railway  

## ✅ Status Update - FIXED!

### Environment Variables Restored
- **Status:** All environment variables set via Railway CLI
- **Build:** Successful (using Nixpacks)  
- **Deploy:** Healthy - app responding on /health endpoint
- **Environment Variables:** All 15 variables restored via `railway variables --set`

### Environment Variables Status
**Set in Railway:** ✅ All 15 environment variables set via Railway CLI
- Stripe API keys (secret, publishable, location ID)
- Email configuration (from/notification emails)
- Organization branding (name, logo, website)
- Google OAuth credentials (client ID, secret, refresh token)
- Membership pricing (individual/household amounts)
- Flask environment and domain settings

**Problem:** Environment variables not being loaded by Flask app despite being set in Railway

### Observed Railway Logs
```
Starting Container
[2025-08-10 16:46:28 +0000] [1] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
[2025-08-10 16:46:28 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8080 (1)
[2025-08-10 16:46:28 +0000] [1] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2025-08-10 16:46:28 +0000] [4] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 4
INFO:app.main:Searching for readers in location: None
ERROR:app.main:Error discovering readers: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
ERROR:app.main:Error creating connection token: No API key provided.
```

**Analysis:**
- Gunicorn starting on port 8080 (should use $PORT)
- Environment variables showing as None/missing
- API key not being loaded by Flask process

## 🛠️ Railway Configuration

### Current railway.json
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app.main:app",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### Flask App Configuration
**Port Handling:** ✅ App uses `os.getenv('PORT', 5000)`  
**API Key Loading:** `stripe.api_key = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY')`  
**Problem:** Environment variables not reaching the Flask process

## 🐛 Debugging Attempts

### Railway CLI Commands Used
```bash
railway login
railway init --name simple-stripe-pos-railway
railway add --service --repo mattbaya/simple-stripe-pos-railway
railway variables --set "KEY=VALUE" # (for each variable)
railway status
railway logs
railway domain  # Generated URL
```

### Direct API Tests
```bash
curl https://jubilant-healing-production.up.railway.app/health
# Result: Connection timeout (healthcheck failing)

curl -X POST https://jubilant-healing-production.up.railway.app/create-connection-token  
# Result: "No API key provided" error
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Likely Issues:
1. **Gunicorn vs Flask Startup:** Railway using gunicorn but environment variables not passed to worker processes
2. **Port Configuration:** App starting on 8080 instead of Railway's dynamic $PORT
3. **Build Context:** Railway might be building from wrong files or context
4. **Environment Variable Injection:** Railway variables not reaching Flask process environment

### Evidence:
- Build succeeds (Docker image created)
- Healthcheck fails (app not responding)
- Logs show gunicorn starting but environment variables as None
- Environment variables confirmed set in Railway dashboard

## 🚀 Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Fix Gunicorn Configuration
- Change startCommand to use proper PORT variable binding
- Ensure gunicorn passes environment to workers
- Test: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --env PORT=$PORT app.main:app`

### Option 2: Use Direct Flask Startup
- Change startCommand to: `python app/main.py`
- Flask will handle PORT environment variable directly
- Simpler for debugging environment variable issues

### Option 3: Debug Environment Loading
- Add logging to show what environment variables Flask sees
- Create debug endpoint: `/debug-env`
- Test environment variable injection

### Option 4: Railway Dashboard Manual Deploy
- Use Railway web interface instead of CLI
- Manual redeploy to refresh environment variable injection
- Check Railway dashboard logs directly

## 🔐 Security Notes
- Environment variables set securely in Railway dashboard
- No secrets in GitHub repository
- API keys not committed to code
- OAuth2 tokens stored as environment variables

## ✅ Working Elements
- ✅ Railway project created
- ✅ GitHub repository connected  
- ✅ Environment variables set via CLI
- ✅ Docker build succeeds
- ✅ Flask app code has proper PORT handling
- ✅ All dependencies in requirements.txt

## ❌ Failing Elements
- ❌ Flask app startup/healthcheck
- ❌ Environment variable loading in Flask process
- ❌ Stripe API key not accessible to app
- ❌ Connection token endpoint failing
- ❌ Reader discovery not working

## 🎯 Priority Fixes
1. **Fix environment variable loading** - Critical for Stripe integration
2. **Fix Flask startup** - Required for basic operation  
3. **Test Stripe Terminal connection** - Core functionality
4. **Verify email functionality** - Receipt system
